Imagine using a third-party function whose implementation you don't know, but whose type signature is this:

```
fn mystery<T>(x: T) -> T {
  // ????
}
```

Then you call `mystery` like this:

```
let y = mystery(3);
```

Assuming `mystery` uses no unsafe code, then the value of `y` must be :
"""
answer.answer = "3"
context = """
The only possible function (without unsafe code) that has the signature `T -> T` is the identity function:

```
fn mystery<T>(x: T) -> T {
  x
}
```

The function could of course panic or print, but the return value can only be the input. `mystery` does not know
what type `T` is, so there is no way for `mystery` to generate or mutate a value of `T`.
See [Theorems for free!](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/99370.99404) for more examples of this idea.

**3 really is the correct answer! If you disagree with the answer, please don't submit a bug report!**

If a type is generic (like `T`), we cannot assume anything about it, including the ability to turn it into a string. Therefore `println!("{x}")` is invalid

These definitions of `f` conflict, and there is no way for Rust to determine which `f` should be used when `p.f()` is called. Therefore this is a compiler error.
