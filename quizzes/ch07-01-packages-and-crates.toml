Imagine you see a Rust package `foobar` with the following files:

```text
foobar
├── Cargo.toml
├── build.rs
└── src/
    ├── main.rs
    ├── util.rs
    ├── lib.rs
    └── bin/
        └── alt.rs
```

How many crates does this package contain? Write your answer as a digit, e.g. 0, 1, and so on.
"""
answer.answer = "3"
context = """ 
`main.rs` produces a binary crate, `lib.rs` produces a library crate, and `bin/alt.rs` produces a binary crate. The `util.rs` would presumably be used as a module within
one of these crates, but it is not a special filename recognized by Rust, so it would not be its own crate. `build.rs` is a build script.
